  <p>Every business wants to grow, innovate, and stay ahead of the competition. But behind every bold move—whether it’s launching a new product or opening a new plant—there’s one crucial question:</p>
  <p><strong>Are we accounting for the risk involved?</strong></p>

  <h2>📊 Risk Is Not the Enemy—Blindness Is</h2>
  <p>Capital budgeting involves committing large sums of money to long-term projects. That’s not something to take lightly. When executives ignore risk, they assume the future will play out as expected. But let’s face it—things rarely go as planned.</p>
  <p>By using tools like <strong>risk-adjusted discount rates</strong>, <strong>scenario analysis</strong>, or <strong>sensitivity analysis</strong>, managers can visualize a range of outcomes—not just the “best case.” This helps them avoid overestimating returns and underestimating uncertainty.</p>

  <blockquote>“Risk doesn’t disappear by ignoring it. It gets more expensive later.” —Adapted from Damodaran (2012)</blockquote>

  <h2>💸 What Happens When Risk Is Ignored?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Overconfident decisions lead to <strong>overinvestment</strong>.</li>
    <li>Projects get approved based on <strong>inflated NPVs</strong>.</li>
    <li>The company becomes vulnerable to <strong>cost overruns or delays</strong>.</li>
    <li>Future borrowing costs go up due to <strong>loss of investor confidence</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🧐 Risk and Strategy Go Hand in Hand</h2>
  <p>Risk is not just a finance issue—it’s a <strong>strategic one</strong>. It tells you where to step carefully and where to double down. Ignoring risk is like playing chess with only half the board visible.</p>
  <p>The use of <strong>CAPM and beta</strong> helps companies estimate the required return based on volatility, and tools like <strong>NPV</strong> and <strong>IRR</strong> guide them toward sound investments.</p>

  <h2>📌 Final Thoughts: Embrace the Uncertainty</h2>
  <p>Ignoring risk won’t make it disappear. In fact, it makes it more dangerous. Capital budgeting should always include a deep understanding of the uncertainty involved. Companies that build risk into their decision-making processes are more resilient, strategic, and profitable over time.</p>
  <p><strong>So, next time your company evaluates a major investment, ask yourself:</strong></p>
  <p><em>Are we looking at the numbers—or the full picture?</em></p>
